## Modular structure for Express and beyond

This repo is a forked version from the modular express example made by the StrongLoop community which has a sample Express application and accompanying StrongLoop article here:

http://strongloop.com/strongblog/modular-node-js-express/

:ThumbsUp to the StrongLoop community and Marc Harter for his post as this is a great tool/starter-kit and a lovely improvement on my own initial starter-kit here ``

## Forked Improvements

Whilst the purposes of the StrongLoop article and repo by Marc Harter are likely intended to be a very simplistic (and very good) starter kit and as un-opinionated as possible, by that, I mean not include too many tools/dependencies tieing in the developer's choice of tools and structure to us I will opinionate further the initial starter-kit to include some 'touches' for a more all-round starter-kit.

..Currently, (as the features are added they remain, as yet, desirables. Here are the features to be added as soon as possible:

- [ ] Migrations Examples - bin folder likely (MySQL or Other SQL language)
- [ ] Migrations Examples - bin folder likely (NoSQL)
- [ ] Migrations Examples - bin folder likely (possibly Graph Databases)
 
- [ ] BrowserSync - bin folder likely - for dev config
- [ ] Sass examples - Yes, instead of LESS or STYLUS or Something else as it is preferred (opinionated choice)
- [ ] GulpFile - instead of Grunt or Other but again, it is preferred and in essence the starter kit needs a build tool
- [ ] Travis CI hook example - possibly
- [ ] More test examples - possibly

- [ ] Isolated custom modules example (or more examples than given)
- [ ] Isolated ReactJS Isomorphic Examples (possible Fork into isomorphic ReactJS & opinionated FLUX architecture starter-kit)
- [ ] Isolated Angular 2.0 Examples (possible Fork into Angular 2.0 starter-kit)
